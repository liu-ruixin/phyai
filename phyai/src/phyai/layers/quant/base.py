"""Op-agnostic core of the spec abstraction.

A :class:`WeightSpec` knows the storage format of a weight tensor — its
dtype, scale layout, and any per-format setup. It does *not* know which
op consumes the weight (linear, embedding, MoE), which kernel runs, or
how the activation should be pre-processed. Op-specific concerns live on
separate Protocols, e.g. :class:`phyai.layers.quant.linear.LinearActivationQuant`.

The contract between a layer and its spec is :class:`AllocationRequest`.
Layers build the request from their own shape conventions (linear's
``(N, K)``, embedding's ``(V_per, D)``, …) and hand it over; specs only
ever see ``weight_shape`` plus a list of per-logical-matrix widths.

    ``weight_shape`` is the *local* (per-rank, post-fuse) shape. For a

    sharded vocab embedding it's ``(num_embeddings_per_partition, embedding_dim)``.

    ``logical_widths`` is the per-sub-matrix breakdown along the fused
    dim — ``[w]`` for a single unfused matrix, ``[gate, up]`` for a
    merged MLP, etc. ``fused_dim`` says which dim the widths sum over;
    both linear and embedding use ``0``.

    ``extras`` is the controlled escape hatch for op-specific config a
    spec may want to look at without polluting the core fields. Prefer
    a typed Protocol over stuffing things here.
